## Sleepy OS
A fully hand written operating system designed for the
x86 architecture with both EFI and BIOS support.


## Questions


### Why BIOS Suppport?
Some people do run a BIOS system daily. Most of them don't know
it. So I will have both BIOS and UEFI so that you have options
if you are unsure on which one you use.

### What's this based off of?
Nothing. If you count OSDev's barebones (UEFI) as being "based",
then yes, it is based off of that.
